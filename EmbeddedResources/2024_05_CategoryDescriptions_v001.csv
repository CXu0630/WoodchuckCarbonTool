"Concrete, CementGrout, Shotcrete, ReadyMix, FlowableFill, PrecastConcrete, ArchitecturalPrecast, StructuralPrecast, UtilityUndergroundPrecast, US Regional Ready-Mix Concrete","Concrete is one of the highest contributors to embodied carbon in buildings. Cement accounts for most of the embodied carbon of concrete and can make up to 79% of total embodied carbon (A1-A3). Portland cement, for instance, involves the calcination of limestone, which is immensely carbon-intensive (both the process of heating and the calcination process itself releases CO2, each process attributes aproximately half of the carbon released). Consequently, the higher-strength concrete results in higher gwp. Aggregates in concrete make up little of its embodied carbon. It is advised to use supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), but balances must be made between structural properties, availability of the SCMs and price (SCM availability is in decline and may continue to do so as their source, steel manufacturing and coal-burning, is decarbonized). Concrete is also very region specific. It is a local material that rarely travels more than 25 miles between production and use. It is advised to use local manufacturer data when assessing embodied carbon of concrete.",https://www.pcl.com/us/en/insights/concrete-solutions-to-lowering-embodied-carbon,
"CMU, Masonry, Brick","Carbon composition in CMU is similar to that of concrete, where the vast majority of embodied carbon comes from the cement. CMU assemblies are less carbon-intensive than cast-in-place concrete, due to them being made from dry-cast concrete and some of the blocks' strength originating from compaction adn vibration of the block machine (making its strength not dependent on cement content alone). Grout in CMU assemblies is also a large contributor to embodied carbon. Grout has a higher embodied carbon content than most concretes. By adding grout to every cell of CMU, the same wall assembly can have tripple the embodied carbon of an ungrouted CMU wall.

"Steel, RebarSteel, WireMeshSteel, HotRolledSections, HollowSections, PlateSteel, ColdFormedSteel, DeckingSteel, SteelSuspensionAssemblies","Steel is one of the highest contributors to embodied carbon in buildings. Steel from Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) result in much lower carbon emissions (up to 3.5 times less) than Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS) steel production. However, the route to reducing carbon emissions is not as simple as converting all blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces due to the finite amount of recycled steel and their limitation of being difficult to use in thin profiled elements. Globally, scrap steel can only supply 40% of global steel demand, so to calculate your project's carbon on a global scale, try to measure your embodied carbon at 40% recycled steel even if you are planning to use a higher percentage to account for other projects having less access to the material. Carbon intensities vary greatly for secondary production, fabrication, and finishes after steel is produced. At this stage, processes involving heating are more carbon-intensive. Currently approximately 90% of steel is recycled.",https://www.istructe.org/IStructE/media/Public/Resources/ARUP-Embodied-carbon-steel.pdf,
"Aluminum, Aluminium, AluminiumExtrusions","Aluminum is a highly carbon-intensive material and should be use sparingly in general. The smelting process from alumina to aluminum is the most carbon intensive part of production. Smelting occurs via electrolysis and uses a large amount of electricity, hence the carbon intensity of aluminum varies significantly between smelters. Coal smelters can have six times the carbon intensity as compared to hydropowered smelters. CO2 is also produced during the chemical conversion of smelting. It is advised to specify aluminum smelted with green energy. Using recycled aluminum also reduces carbon emissions significantly, though global supply of recycled aluminum can only account for 30% of demand.",https://www.canadianarchitect.com/embodied-carbon-key-considerations-for-key-materials/,
"Wood and Composites, WoodFraming, SheathingPanels, MassTimber, CompositeLumber, PrefabricatedWood, NonStructuralWood, WoodJoists","Wood is understood to be a material that sequesters carbon as opposed to releasing it. When a tree is left to die, it releases most of its stored carbon back into the atmosphere, but by using it as a construction material, we are able to store that carbon in our buildings as well as make space to grow new trees. It is important to source wood materials from manufacturers with sustainable forestry practices. ",,
