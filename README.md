What is this tool?

This plugin is used to provide easy access to the EC3 carbon database (and hopefully other carbon databases in near future) from within Rhino. It includes calculator functionality that can be used to quickly calculate embodied carbon of modeled geometry.

How to use this tool?

Use the SearchEPD command to search the carbon databases for materials that fit your requirement. For more details on each material, use the View in Browser button to see the original EC3 site. Embodied carbon materials can be assigned to Rhino Objects similar to rendering materials. To assign a material to geometry, use the Assign to Geometry button and pick out the geometry you want to assign to.
